I am working in a cooperation between the {{< links link="https://www.uniklinik-ulm.de/radiologie-diagnostische-und-interventionelle.html" text="Department of Interventional and Diagnostic Radiology at Ulm University Hospital" >}}
and the {{< links link="https://viscom.uni-ulm.de/" text="Institute for Media Informatics (Visual Computing Group) at Ulm University." >}}

My vision is to support radiologists and other medical staff in their daily work by using Artificial Intelligence. My particular focus is on research in the areas of deep learning for medical imaging as well as self-supervised pre-training and explainable artificial antelligence.

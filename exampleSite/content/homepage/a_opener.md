I am researching artificial intelligence in medical imaging in a collaboration between the {{< links link="https://www.uniklinik-ulm.de/radiologie-diagnostische-und-interventionelle.html" text="Clinic of Radiology" >}}
and the {{< links link="https://viscom.uni-ulm.de/" text="Visual Computing Research Group" >}} at the Univerity of Ulm. 

My vision is to use artificial intelligence to assist physicians, improve medical diagnosis, and help patients.
